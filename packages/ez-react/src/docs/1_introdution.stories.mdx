# EazyChart Library

> **EazyChart library is currently in ALPHA**.

With the EazyChart library, we want to democratize chart development. This library is a set of reusable components that will help you with charts development.

## Our vision

We want to create a chart library that results in:

- Understanding of how each chart works and how you can use, adapt or customize it to create a great user experience.
- Short development times and consistent code quality.
- A beautiful, visually consistent data visualization experience.
- Transparency about how we work and what we do.

### Maintained by Hexastack and you

Hexastack has a team of developers that actively helps create and maintain components. We make sure that components are well documented and easy to use. Feel free to contribute!

### How to get involved

When we notice that we need to change something, we determine together what the change should be, then we put the change in place and communicate it publicly. Throughout the process, we strive to involve you and meet your needs. We are looking forward to discussing your design and improvement ideas on [GitHub](https://github.com/Hexastack/eazychart/issues).

## Get started

- **Explore components**
  Click on any of the chart component in the sidebar to see how they look, and how to configure them. Each component pages contains documentation of its properties, as well as code examples for how to use it.
- **Try them out**
  - Experiment with different properties, by clicking **Canvas** at the top of each component page.
  - Change the properties under **Knobs** in the bottom panel.
- **Use them**
  Once you've found the right chart component for your use case, click the **Story** tab to see the code implementation, or look at examples under **Docs**.
