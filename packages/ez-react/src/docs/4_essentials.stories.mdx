# Essentials

## Custom CSS

**EazyChart** offers the ability to style your charts and components as you wish.
You can use the styles found in the `eazychart-css` package, or use your custom styling by overriding `eazychart-css` styles.
Doing so is by writing your own CSS file and adding it to your project with your custom style.

Create a `.css` file and add your styling into it as the example above:

Let’s override the style of the tooltip.
Instead of black background and white text we want a white background and black bold text.

Create a `.css` file and add your styling into it as the example above:

```css
/* ez-styles.css */
.ez-tooltip-text {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: #000;
}
.ez-tooltip {
  background-color: #ffffff95; /* With some opacity */
}
```

And then import your css file into your app main file like so:

```js
import './ez-styles.css';
```

> **Note:** import the file only in the app main file, you won’t need to import it in every component.

Save the file and you will get the next results.

A complete Vue code example:

```html
<template>
  <BarChart :data="rawData" :onResize="onResize" :colors="colors"></BarChart>
</template>
<script>
  import { BarChart } from 'eazychart-vue';
  import 'eazychart-css';

  export default {
    name: 'App',
    components: {
      BarChart,
    },
    data() {
      return {
        rawData: [
          { yValue: 'Alpha', xValue: 5 },
          { yValue: 'Beta', xValue: 4 },
          { yValue: 'Gamma', xValue: 3 },
        ],
        colors: ['#fe4a49', '#2ab7ca', '#fed766'],
      };
    },
    methods: {
      onResize() {},
    },
  };
</script>
<style>
  .ez-tooltip-text {
    font-weight: bold;
    color: #000;
  }
  .ez-tooltip {
    background-color: #ffffff95;
  }
</style>
```

> All the css classes can be found in the [Github repo](https://github.com/Hexastack/eazychart/tree/master/packages/ez-css).

## Responsive Charts

All chart recipes in **EazyChart** comes with fixed width,
by default the chart comes with a `800x600` dimensions which can be overwritten if you wish to have a certain chart dimensions.

Although, the chart recipes can have a responsive behavior.
To do so, wrap your chart recipe with the `ResponsiveChartContainer`.
This container will let your chart have the dimensions of the outer container where you are putting it.

```jsx
// for React Web app
import { ResponsiveChartContainer } from 'eazychart-react';
// imports

const MyApp = (props) => {
  // your component logic

  return (
    <ResponsiveChartContainer>
      // your chart recipe
    </ResponsiveChartContainer>
  );
};
```

```html
// for Vue Web app
<template>
  <ResponsiveChartContainer> 
    // your chart recipe 
  </ResponsiveChartContainer>
</template>

<script>
  import { ResponsiveChartContainer } from 'eazychart-vue
  // other imports

  // component logic
</script>

<style>
  // your styles
</style>
```

## Common Props 

In this section, we will cover properties that most of the charts have in common. 
These so-called props are responsible for the display and behavior of your chart. 

### Data

When adding a chart to your web project, 
or creating a new chart recipe, We need to think about the fuel that we will use to fill up our engine, which is data.
**EazyChart** handles it through its chart wrapper. 

So if you are creating some sort of visualization for your web project, 
you don’t have to worry about the data processing phase. 
If you are creating a new chart recipe, 
EazyChart has a couple of built-in functions that you can use to preprocess your data and make it presentable on your chart.

```js
const data = [
  {
	gdp: 19.485,
	country: 'United States',
  },
  {
	gdp: 12.238,
	country: 'China',
  },
  {
	gdp: 4.872,
	country: 'Japan',
  },
];
```
