# Your First Chart

Now that you installed **EazyChart**, you will have the ability to use it and add a chart in your **React** or **Vue** web project.

EazyChart provides a set of ready-to-use charts that you can fully customize. In the example below, you will be adding a "Bar Chart" to a React project. First, you need to import the **BarChart** component from the library.

```js
// Code for importing the bar chart component
import { BarChart } from 'eazychart-react';
import 'eazychart-css';
```

The above code will import the Bar chart to where you want it to show.
So use it to import the chart inside the parent component.

A quick note, to get the appropriate styles for your chart, you’ll have to import the `eazychart-css` package.

> **NOTE** `!`
> **You should import it once into your app main file, and it won't be systematic with every chart import.**

Cool, now that you imported the Bar chart from the library, you are ready to use it in your project.

Hang on there, you still have a couple of things to do. You need to define the data that the chart should display:

```js
const data = [
  { country: 'Italy', population: 65 },
  { country: 'Spain', population: 46 },
  { country: 'Australia', population: 25 },
];
```

Awesome. Now you’ll need to configure the chart. To do so, we will need to create an object that will contain all the props we need to define.

As an example. In order to display a Bar chart into your project, you will need to specify :

- The data that you will be displaying (data).
- The axes that you will use to represent the data on. Basic charts typically have two axes that are used to plot data in two dimensions (X Axis and Y Axis).

```js
const props = {
  data: data,
  xAxis: {
    domainKey: 'population',
    title: 'Population',
    nice: 2,
  },
  yAxis: {
    domainKey: 'country',
    title: 'Country',
  },
};
```

The **xAxis** is for defining the horizontal axis or the x-axis that will display the values in the data (numerical values). **yAxis** is for defining the vertical axis or y-axis that will display the value part of the data (categorical values).

You can specify other chart properties (please refer to documentation about **Bar Chart** for more details).

For every axis, we will need to define a set of properties, mainly the axis direction, the domain key and the title. For the x-axis, we are defining a property called **‘nice’** that will add a margin so that the least value can be displayed.

You can learn more about more properties in the Axis section.

Cool, now that everything is set up in place, let’s write the JSX code to display the chart using the props that we defined earlier.

Your code should look like this:

```jsx
// Full example of creating a Bar chart
import React from 'react';
import { BarChart } from 'eazychart-react';
import 'eazychart-css';

export const App = () => {
  const data = [
    { country: 'Italy', population: 65 },
    { country: 'Spain', population: 46 },
    { country: 'Australia', population: 25 },
  ];
  const props = ;

  return (
    <div>
      <BarChart
        data={data}
        xAxis={{
          domainKey: 'population',
          title: 'Population',
          nice: 2,
        }}
        yAxis={{
          domainKey: 'country',
          title: 'Country',
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

Now that everything is in order, run your project using npm or yarn, open up your browser, and you should be able to see your chart on your screen.

```sh
npm run start
```

Or

```sh
yarn start
```

Congratulations 👏, you have added a chart to your project. If you want to learn more about **EazyChart**, check the available charts, and experiment with our live components. If you want to contribute, refer to our GitHub page.

> Note that the same steps that we have been going through, apply as well to a Vue project. Feel free to import another chart and test it out, the only difference would be the props that you would want to pass on. There are props that are common across all the charts, while others are specific to certain types of charts.
